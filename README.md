    <li><b>Customer's Choice</b>: Have different upgrades available for purchase that modify cookies per second or cookies per click.</li>
    <li><b>Rainbow Sprinkles</b>: Add additional styles to the webpage to make it look fancy.</li>
    <li><b>Automated Bakery</b>: Add new upgrades that have a prerequisite on other upgrades (eg: you need a grandma for every oven, or you can't buy more ovens).</li>
